## The Big Picture

### Overview
  Positive, passionate sustainability focused professional seeking to do the most "good" possible. Standing in the remote backcountry of the world's first official national park inspired the goal to help human kind improve its relationship with the planet. I saw first hand the power of nature, its ability to calm us, heal us, and sustain us. I knew we as a society were out of balance and not acting in ways that would enable to worlds population to live healthily and happily. Since that formidable experience I have researched, tested, and implemented ways to engage the local community and reduce environmental impacts.  

### ENVY
  That formidable volunteer trail crew experience in Yellowstone inspired me to purse a B.S. degree in environmental science. Over the course of that chapter of my education I learned more about what I first realized during that summer in high school. Over consumption, pollution, impacts of fossil fuels, and many more topics made me weary. How could we possibly fix this? Inspiration struck again during a visit to a mid size farm as part of my environmental management class. This farm had it all. Rotating chicken coups, the largest composting pile I had ever seen, rotating the cattle on different fields, water buffers, and more. The paramount moment was when they took our class into an old barn that they had converted into a little country store. It had meats and cheeses from the farm, eggs, someone down the road made jam and pasta, and someone else in the community made wooden toys that were also for sale in this shop. I thought one of these should be in every town, the country store for the 21st century. That night I sprung out of bed with a new business idea, create the first recognizable nationwide sustainability brand that provided the most environmentally friendly products with a focus on locally made. This business would be called ENVY, which stands for environmental necessities, valuables, and YOU! That way you can be green with envy ;)

### Coding
  * Notable projects
    * ENVY Angular- Web application built using Angular. Created a framework where users can see sustainability stories and assess their environmental impact. Used firebase to set up a database and deploy application. The modular aspect is what excites me most about this project. Used separate services to retrieve information from the database and kept code organized using 7 different components. Will add user authentication so users can keep track of their environmental score and add their own stories.

    * Epicoin - Ruby web application that emulates a blockchain node with the goal to educate and provide deeper understanding of blockchain technology. 
  * Chicago dataset
  * Modularity and developed skills

### Nature and the great outdoors

  * Rock climbing
